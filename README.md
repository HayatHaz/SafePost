AI-Powered Post PII Detection System
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Every day, people share personal information on social media, whether intentionally or by mistake. making them vulnerable to privacy breaches and identity theft. 
Our project is an AI-powered tool that takes a post from the user and analyses it for PII. alerting users to potential privacy risks before sharing the post.
